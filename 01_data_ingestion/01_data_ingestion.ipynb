    "## Understanding Hive Metastore Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "In Databricks, the Hive metastore provides a centralized repository to store metadata for tables and partitions. For our fake news detection project, we have two tables in the Hive metastore:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`fake`**: Contains fake news articles with columns: title, text, subject, date\n",

    "### Why Use Hive Tables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Hive metastore tables offers several advantages over reading from CSV files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Centralized Metadata**: Schema information is stored centrally, ensuring consistency across sessions and users\n",
    "2. **Optimized Performance**: Databricks optimizes query execution on Hive tables\n",
    "3. **Access Control**: Tables can have access controls applied at the table level\n",
    "4. **Persistence**: Tables persist across cluster restarts and sessions\n",
    "5. **Catalog Integration**: Tables are visible in the Databricks catalog UI\n",
