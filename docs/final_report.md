# Fake News Detection System: Final Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive fake news detection system implemented using Apache Spark (PySpark) and designed for deployment on Databricks Community Edition. The system employs multiple machine learning approaches, including traditional models, deep learning with LSTM networks, transformer-based models, and graph-based solutions using GraphX.

The project successfully demonstrates how to build an end-to-end Big Data solution for detecting fake news, from offline model training to online streaming classification. The implementation follows data science best practices, including proper cross-validation, prevention of data leakage, and comprehensive model evaluation.

Our comparative analysis reveals that transformer-based models, particularly RoBERTa, achieve the highest performance in terms of F1 score, followed closely by the GraphX-enhanced solution that combines textual and graph-based features. The streaming pipeline successfully demonstrates real-time classification capabilities within the constraints of Databricks Community Edition.

This report details the methodology, implementation, results, and recommendations for future enhancements of the fake news detection system.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Fake news has become a significant societal challenge in the digital age, with potential to influence public opinion, political outcomes, and social stability. Developing automated systems to detect fake news is crucial for maintaining information integrity. This project aims to create a scalable, accurate fake news detection system using Big Data technologies.

### 1.2 Project Objectives

1. Develop a machine learning pipeline for classifying news articles as real or fake
2. Implement and compare multiple modeling approaches, from basic to advanced
3. Create a streaming pipeline for real-time classification
4. Design a solution compatible with Databricks Community Edition
5. Provide comprehensive documentation for reproducibility

### 1.3 Approach

The project follows a structured approach:

1. **Data Preparation**: Loading, cleaning, and preprocessing labeled datasets
2. **Feature Engineering**: Text vectorization and graph-based feature extraction
3. **Model Development**: Implementation of multiple model types
4. **Evaluation**: Rigorous cross-validation and performance comparison
5. **Streaming Implementation**: Real-time classification pipeline
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive technical documentation and tutorials

## 2. Data Analysis and Preparation

### 2.1 Dataset Overview

The project uses two primary datasets:
- `Fake.csv`: Contains fake news articles
- `True.csv`: Contains real news articles

Each dataset includes the article text, title, and additional metadata. The combined dataset contains a substantial number of articles, providing a robust foundation for model training and evaluation.

### 2.2 Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing pipeline includes:

1. **Text Cleaning**: Removing special characters, converting to lowercase
2. **Tokenization**: Breaking text into individual tokens
3. **Stopword Removal**: Eliminating common words with limited semantic value
4. **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base forms

### 2.3 Feature Engineering

Multiple feature engineering approaches were implemented:

1. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converting text to numerical features based on term frequency and inverse document frequency
2. **Word Embeddings**: For deep learning models (LSTM, Transformers)
3. **Graph-Based Features**: Extracting features from word co-occurrence graphs using GraphX

### 2.4 Data Augmentation

To enhance model robustness, data augmentation techniques were applied:
- Synonym replacement
- Balanced dataset creation through undersampling/oversampling

Care was taken to prevent data leakage by ensuring augmentation only used information available at the time of article publication.

## 3. Model Development and Evaluation

### 3.1 Baseline Models

Three baseline models were implemented and evaluated:

1. **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees
2. **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem
3. **Logistic Regression**: A linear model for binary classification

These models served as a performance baseline for comparison with more advanced approaches.

### 3.2 LSTM Models

Two LSTM-based models were implemented:

1. **Standard LSTM**: A basic Long Short-Term Memory network
2. **Bidirectional LSTM**: An enhanced LSTM that processes sequences in both directions

These models leverage sequential information in text, potentially capturing contextual relationships better than baseline models.

### 3.3 Transformer Models

Three transformer-based models were implemented:

1. **DistilBERT**: A distilled version of BERT, offering efficiency with competitive performance
2. **BERT**: The original Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model
3. **RoBERTa**: A robustly optimized BERT approach with improved training methodology

These models represent the state-of-the-art in NLP and were expected to provide superior performance.

### 3.4 GraphX Solution

A novel approach using GraphX was implemented:

1. **Word Co-occurrence Graph**: Creating a graph representation of word relationships
2. **Graph-Based Features**: Extracting centrality and other graph metrics as features
3. **Combined Model**: Integrating graph features with traditional text features

This approach explores the structural relationships between words, potentially capturing information not present in sequential or bag-of-words models.

### 3.5 Cross-Validation and Evaluation

All models were evaluated using:

1. **Stratified Cross-Validation**: Ensuring balanced class representation across folds
2. **Multiple Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC
3. **Data Leakage Prevention**: Temporal splitting where applicable

## 4. Model Comparison and Results
