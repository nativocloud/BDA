### Pipeline Flow

```
Data Sources → Ingestion → Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → Modeling (Traditional / Deep Learning) → Analysis (Graph, Clustering, Temporal) → Deployment
                                                                                                                  ↓
                                                                                                            Visualization
                                                                                                                  ↓
                                                                                                        Streaming Simulation

## Phase 3: Feature Engineering

Transforms preprocessed text into numerical features suitable for machine learning.

### Rationale

Machine learning models require numerical input. This phase converts textual information into meaningful quantitative representations, capturing various aspects of the data to improve model performance.

### Key Components & Rationale

1.  **Text Vectorization (Sparse)**: Converting text into high-dimensional sparse vectors.
    *   **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Uses HashingTF and IDF. *Rationale: Standard, effective technique weighting word importance based on frequency within a document relative to its frequency across all documents. Good baseline for text classification.*
    *   **CountVectorizer (Bag-of-Words)**: Counts word occurrences. *Rationale: Simpler representation, sometimes useful as an alternative or complement to TF-IDF.*
    *   **N-gram Features**: Capturing sequences of words (e.g., "White House"). *Rationale: Preserves local word order and captures phrases, which can be more informative than individual words. Can be used with TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.*

2.  **Text Vectorization (Dense - Embeddings)**: Creating lower-dimensional dense vectors capturing semantic meaning.
    *   **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)**: Represent individual words as dense vectors.
        *   *Rationale*: Captures semantic relationships (e.g., "king" is closer to "queen" than "apple"), often leading to better performance than sparse methods, especially when context matters. Allows using pre-trained knowledge from large corpora (GloVe) or training custom embeddings for domain specificity (Word2Vec).
        *   *Comparison*: GloVe leverages global co-occurrence stats (often better for semantics), Word2Vec uses local context (faster custom training, good for syntax).
    *   **Sentence Embeddings (SBERT, USE, InferSent, Doc2Vec, LaBSE)**: Represent entire sentences or documents as single dense vectors.
        *   *Rationale*: Captures the meaning of the whole text unit, preserving context better than averaging word embeddings. Useful for semantic similarity, clustering, and classification, especially for shorter texts like titles.
        *   *Encoders*: 
            *   *SBERT*: BERT optimized for sentence similarity.
            *   *USE*: General-purpose sentence encoder (Transformer/DAN variants).
            *   *InferSent*: BiLSTM-based, good for inference tasks.
            *   *Doc2Vec*: Extends Word2Vec to documents, lighter weight.
            *   *LaBSE*: Language-agnostic for multilingual tasks.
        *   *Choice Rationale*: Depends on task (similarity vs. classification), computational resources (Transformers are heavier), and language requirements (LaBSE for multilingual).

3.  **Feature Extraction**: Creating additional features from text content or metadata.
    *   *Text Length, Readability Scores, Sentiment Score*. *Rationale: Captures stylistic or meta-information not present in word counts/embeddings.*
    *   *Metadata Features* (Source, Location). *Rationale: Leverages contextual information associated with the article.*
    *   *Entity Recognition Features* (Counts of people/orgs). *Rationale: Focuses on key actors mentioned.*

4.  **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing feature space size (e.g., PCA, SVD, Feature Selection).
    *   *Rationale*: Improves model training time, reduces overfitting, enhances interpretability, especially crucial for high-dimensional sparse vectors or complex embeddings.*
    *   *Techniques*: PCA/SVD for dense features, Feature Selection (ChiSqSelector, VarianceThreshold) for sparse features.

5.  **Feature Scaling**: Normalizing or standardizing features (e.g., MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler).
    *   *Rationale*: Many algorithms (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks) perform better or converge faster when features are on a similar scale.*

### Core Functions & Rationale

Emphasizes seamless connection between phases.

### Rationale

Well-integrated pipelines are efficient, manageable, and less error-prone. Ensures smooth data flow and consistency.

### Integrated Data Flow & Rationale

1.  **Data Persistence**: Saving phase outputs (Parquet/Hive). *Rationale: Decouples phases, ensures data availability.*
2.  **Metadata Propagation**: Preserving context (timestamps, sources). *Rationale: Retains information.*
3.  **Consistent Interfaces**: Standardized functions/schemas. *Rationale: Easy connection.*
4.  **Pipeline Optimization**: Eliminating redundancy. *Rationale: Improves efficiency.*

### Optimization Strategies & Rationale

1.  **Single-Pass Processing**: Combining operations. *Rationale: Reduces I/O/computation.*
2.  **Memory Management**: Coordinated caching. *Rationale: Optimizes resource use.*
3.  **Resource Sharing**: Broadcast variables. *Rationale: Avoids redundant loading.*
4.  **Parallel Execution**: Running independent branches. *Rationale: Speeds up execution.*

## Best Practices
