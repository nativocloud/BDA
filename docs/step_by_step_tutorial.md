## 1. Environment Setup

### 1.1 Setting Up Local Development Environment

First, we need to set up a local environment that mimics Databricks Community Edition:

```bash
# Create project directory structure
mkdir -p fake_news_detection/{01_data_ingestion,02_preprocessing,03_feature_engineering,04_modeling,05_graph_analysis,06_clustering,07_streaming,08_visualization,09_deployment,docs}/utils

# Install required dependencies
pip install pyspark==3.3.0 findspark jupyterlab jupytext delta-spark==2.1.0
pip install nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy
```

### 1.2 Configuring PySpark

Create a configuration script to ensure consistent Spark settings:

**File: `/home/ubuntu/fake_news_detection_organized/05_graph_analysis/configure_java_env.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set Java environment variables
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

# Create Spark configuration
mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/fake_news_detection_organized/config
cat > /home/ubuntu/fake_news_detection_organized/config/spark_config.sh << EOL
#!/bin/bash
export SPARK_HOME=/usr/local/spark
export PYTHONPATH=\$SPARK_HOME/python:\$PYTHONPATH
export PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3
export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=python3
EOL

chmod +x /home/ubuntu/fake_news_detection_organized/config/spark_config.sh
echo "Java and Spark environment configured successfully!"
```
