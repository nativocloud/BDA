# Technical Architecture: Fake News Detection System

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical architecture of the Fake News Detection system, designed to classify news articles as either real or fake using machine learning techniques. The system is implemented in a local development environment that mimics Databricks Community Edition, with provisions for deployment to the actual Databricks platform.

## 2. System Overview

The Fake News Detection system consists of two main components:

1. **Offline Model Training Pipeline**: Processes historical labeled data to train and evaluate various machine learning models for fake news detection.
2. **Online Streaming Pipeline**: Simulates real-time processing of incoming news articles, applying the trained model to classify them as real or fake.
